I made a simple interactive menu with a pokemon api that allows the user to
search for pokemon by name
compare two pokemon
get a pokemon evolution chain

Main issue
api structure
the pokemon api is structured strangley so I had to get the api, then get the imbedded link inside of the api to then use in the code
the next issue was filtering what data it would show.  The api has a lot of unneccessary content in my opinion. I had to find find each stat then pull the base stat from said stat
